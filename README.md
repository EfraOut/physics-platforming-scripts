# Overview

This is my first experience working on the Unity Game Framework. I enjoy playing 2D platfrormers, and that is why I decided to give it a try.
The game is very simple to play:
* Use the Left and Right arrows (or A and D) to move left and right
* Spacebar to jump
* ESC to pause the game

The objective of the game is to fit within the walls.

Here is a demo on the game

# Development Environment

I used Unity for the game environment, with scipts written in C#

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Pause menu seems to not work completly
* Have more levels using a block as a helper
* Add some functionality to allow multiplayer
